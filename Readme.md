Need a replacement for the resume & single place where I have my blogs. 
While there are many tools that can make an enticing resume, a personal website has its own charm. A resume only gives a quick view of me, but recruiters who need to know me in depth will want to visit the website to get a comprehensive insight to me as a personality. Plus a website kind of emits reliability. A person with a website is less likely to over-quote / false quote in his resume :)

Here are some confessions as well .. 

1. I was exploring server side pages using Go Gin. AngularJS is ok, but can I be that versatile ?
2. My upskill plan on Kubernetes has been pending long - this gives me an opportunity to complete that. Lets ditch docker-compose and go ahead to use Kubernetes this time. 

### Profile showcase:
-----
Cardinal aim is to host my profile on the web. This is with a aim to create the standout effect for recruiters. While for most of the cases the resume does the job well, if any recruiter is seeking more insight this website can give him/her exactly that. Moreover it also gives a sense of reliability to the persona. Had you faked any part of your profile would you have the audacity to put on a website for the whole world to see ?
Then again, a website also stands as a testimonial for your skills - `Golang` `HTTP REST JSON` `Git` `Docker` `Kubernetes` and slightly virtue signalling with `Mongo` as well :)

### All the blogs at one place:
------
My blogs were all scattered over a couple of blogging websites. This brings all of them concisely under one roof. It has attracted good number of readers we now want them all to re-visit this website.

### Docker-compose for now, Kubernetes finally:
-----
For the sake of getting a website up and running we tread on familiar waters. Once we have a website running its time to switch. Notice how Im experimenting with Go GIN server pages as well.

### Mongo as a small database:
--------
Meta data for blogs, profile data everything needs persistence - to get around this quickly we again go for something we have worked in the past.
We use MongoDB as a small database.

### Spinning up the containers:
